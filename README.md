# Color-sorting-robot-using-Gazebo
This is a simple implementation of a color sorting robot in Gazebo environment.
The manipulator is created in gazebo and its working is governed by the three python files goven in this repository. "colorDetect.py" takes care of checking the color of the block which the robot picks.
"sorter.py" takes care of sorting the blocks based on color detected.
